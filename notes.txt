This section is the constructor method (__init__) for the ServiceGmail class. The constructor is used to initialize a new instance of the class. Here is a breakdown of what it does:

Parameters:
service_account_file: A string representing the path to a service account JSON key file that is used for authentication.
scopes: A list of strings representing the OAuth 2.0 scopes for the API. These scopes define the level of access to the Gmail API.
What This Code Does:
Authentication with Service Account:

The line self.credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(service_account_file, scopes=scopes):
Loads credentials from the specified service_account_file.
Uses these credentials to authenticate with the specified scopes that control what actions can be performed (e.g., reading emails, sending emails).
This Credentials.from_service_account_file() method creates a Credentials object based on the service account file provided.
Building the Gmail Service:

The line self.service = build('gmail', 'v1', credentials=self.credentials):
Uses the build() function from the googleapiclient.discovery module to create a Gmail API service object.
This service object represents the Gmail API ('gmail') at version 'v1' and is authenticated using the credentials created earlier.
This self.service object is used to interact with the Gmail API, allowing you to make requests such as retrieving emails or sending messages.
Summary:
The __init__ method initializes the ServiceGmail class by:

Loading and setting up credentials from a service account file.
Creating a service object that can be used to make API requests to the Gmail API.
